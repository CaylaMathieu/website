## Current projects:

### What is the role and how are regulated  *T. brucei* stress granules during parasite differentiation?

For this project, that requires in-situ tagging and imaging, I supervised a Honours student, Eliza Waskett, who was rewarded with the SBS Honours Prize 2020 for her work under my supervision. We were able to determine that stress granules[^1] were dynamically relocated during the course of *in vivo* differentiation. 

We have also developed a proximity labelling system using the APEX2 tag to allow the identification of new components of stress granules formed during the quorum sensing differentiation. Indeed, we observed that the composition of differentiation granules is different from glucose starvation stress granules. 

In parallel, we performed a bioinformatic analysis during the lockdown imposed by the current COVID outbreak that aimed to identify low complexity regions (LCRs) in the proteome of *T. brucei*. Indeed, the formation of stress granules occurs through liquid-liquid phase separation of the proteins that is facilitated by the presence of low complexity regions. We were able to determine an enrichment of LCRs in protein’s extremities and particularly on the C-terminal regions of proteins involved in nucleic acid binding. We then linked the regulation of these regions to post-translational modifications and were able to show that phosphorylations are strongly enriched in LCRs. These results open the way to study the regulations of stress granules formation by the action of protein kinases and phosphatases in kinetoplastids parasites and were released in a publication in Open Wellcome research in 2020[^2].
