## PhD:
During my PhD at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, under the supervision of Dr. Gerald F. Spath, I functionally characterised protein kinases in the parasites *Leishmania donovani* and *Leishmania major*.

As part of a collaborative project, I participated in the development of a plasmid shuffle technology to analyse the functions of essential genes in Leishmania. This technology is based on the introduction of a “protective” plasmid containing the gene of interest, followed by deletions of the endogenous gene, to generate a conditional knock-out. The “protective” plasmid contains also the gene coding for the insect thymidine kinase. In the presence of the anti-viral drug ganciclovir, the thymidine kinase phosphorylates the ganciclovir and generates a toxic analogue of the deoxyguanosine base. If the gene of interest is not essential for the survival of the parasite, the fitness cost of the toxic deoxyguanosine base leads to the loss of the protective plasmid during parasite replication, thus generating a knock-out. On the opposite, if the gene of interest is essential for the parasite survival in the condition studied, parasites will maintain the protective plasmid despite the energy cost and toxicity in presence of the ganciclovir. In addition, I performed an in-silico modelling analysis to predict the effect of point mutations of the *L. major* MAP kinase 4. All together, these results allowed me join a publication in Molecular Microbiology in 2014[^1].

In parallel, my main project was focussed on the functional characterisation of the Leishmania MAP kinase 10 (MPK10) during parasite the differentiation from the promastigote insect stage to the mammalian intracellular amastigote stage. Using the plasmid shuffle technology, I generated a conditional knock-out of MPK10 in *L. donovani*. My results showed that MPK10 is not essential in the promastigote or differentiated amastigote stage, but is required during amastigote differentiation for adaptation to the elevated temperature upon transmission to the mammal host. 

Using phosphoproteomic approaches, I identified multiple phosphorylated residues on MPK10. This analysis, combined with the identification of divergent residues or unique domains in the kinase core of MPK10 enabled me to perform a structure/function analysis of MPK10. I developed a FACS based assay to systematically study 1) the expression level of the ectopically mutated and WT protein kinases and 2) the effect of these mutations on the phenotype of *in vitro* differentiation from promatigotes to axenic amastigotes. Additionally, I purified the tagged mutated versions of the kinase directly from parasites and developed an in-gel kinase assay, based on the transfer of a radiolabelled phosphate from ATP to the generic MBP substrate. This systematic analysis of divergent residues and domains of MPK10 enabled me to reveal unique regulation mechanisms of the kinase as described in [Figure 1](#figure-1). These results were shared to the community by a publication in PLOS Pathogen in 2014[^2], and through oral presentations and poster presentations at multiple national and international conferences in Israel, USA and France.

*MPK10 is partially active in promastigotes and kept in a standby configuration by auto-inhibition. During the first 48 h of axenic amastigote differentiation, MPK10 is released from auto-inhibition. This activity seems to be controlled by a feedback loop where MPK10 regulates its own tyrosine phosphorylation levels. Thereafter, MPK10 activity is decreased, likely due to dephosphorylation of the TxY motif and phosphorylation of S395.*


Finally, I was also given the opportunity for a scientific exchange with the Pasteur Institute in Montevideo, Uruguay, in the team of Dr. Alejandro Buschiazzo. The purpose of this exchange was to learn to generate and resolve the crystal structure of the full-length of the *L. major* MPK10.
