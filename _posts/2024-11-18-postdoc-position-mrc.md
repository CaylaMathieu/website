# About the Role

For informal enquiries, please contact Dr. Mathieu Cayla at <mathieu.cayla@york.ac.uk>

We’re looking for a highly motivated **Postdoctoral Research Associate** (PDRA) to join the [Department of Biology](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/research/) at the University of York. You will work in Dr. [Mathieu Cayla’s group](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/people/mathieu-cayla/) investigating the adaptation mechanisms enabling African trypanosomes to progress through their life cycle and to adapt to their hosts.

Your main task will be to drive a project to characterise the signalling pathways that regulate autophagy, lysosome exocytosis and biomolecular condensates during the lifecycle differentiations and host adaptation of the African trypanosome T. brucei. As part of our team, you’ll gain hands-on experience with advanced techniques, including high-throughput live imaging, gene silencing screens, mass spectrometry, and murine infection models. This role offers a unique opportunity to develop an exceptional set of skills and contribute to groundbreaking research. You will also contribute towards other projects, help supervise student projects, and contribute to the smooth running of the lab as required.

# About You

 - You will have a PhD or be expecting to receive a PhD in the near future in Molecular Biology, Cell Biology or Microbiology.
 - You will have in-depth knowledge of cell/molecular biology and parasitology.
 - Experience in modern techniques, such as -omics and/or super-resolution microscopy will be especially welcome.
 - You will have evidence of having done high quality research relevant to the position (e.g. published articles and/or preprints), and developed your communication skills through international presentations.
 - You should be willing to contribute towards other projects ongoing in the lab.
 - You will have a collaborative spirit, keen attention to detail, and able to contribute to a lively, friendly and supportive team atmosphere.

For further information regarding the skills required for this role please see the [job description](https://jobs.york.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.view_blob?p_web_site_id=3885&p_web_page_id=573678&p_type=JOBDOC&p_id=513749&p_show=N).

If you are near submission or have recently submitted your PhD but have not yet had it conferred, any offers of employment will be made as Research Assistant at the top of level 5 of the University grade structure. Upon receipt of evidence of the successful award of your PhD, you will be promoted to Research Fellow on the first point of level 6 of the University grade structure.

# Why Join Us

By joining our team, you’ll be part of an internationally recognized [York Biomedical Research Institute](https://www.york.ac.uk/biomedical-research-institute/) that pushes the boundaries of science. You’ll work in state-of-the-art facilities and collaborate with leading scientists, all while developing skills that are transferable across multiple scientific fields. Our Lab is committed to fostering an inclusive and supportive atmosphere that encourages personal and professional growth.
