Applications are invited for a postdoctoral researcher for 36 months to characterise the signalling pathways that regulate autophagy, lysosome exocytosis and biomolecular condensates during the lifecycle differentiations and host adaptation of the African trypanosome *T. brucei*. The position is funded by a MRC CDA to [Dr. Mathieu Cayla](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/people/mathieu-cayla/) who will manage the post.  

The project will require the use of a wide range of different techniques such as high−throughput live imaging, gene silencing screens, mass spectrometry and murine infection, giving plenty of opportunity to develop transferable skills.  

The position requires you to have a PhD in Molecular Biology, Cell Biology or Microbiology. For this multidisciplinary project, you will bring knowledge and expertise in standard molecular biology, -omics studies and imaging techniques. It would be highly desirable to have previous experience in one or more of the following: handling murine models and pathogens of class 2, in protein kinases  and signalling, in -omics data analysis, super resolution microscopy and/or live imaging, and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated precision editing.  

# Department of Biology

Our laboratories provide a supportive and collaborative environment in which the PDRA can contribute fully, flourish and expand their range and learn new techniques. [The Department of Biology](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/research/) is renowned internationally for its research, and the successful applicant will join a team of researchers in the [York Biomedical Research Institute](https://www.york.ac.uk/biomedical-research-institute/) investigating cellular processes in parasites that cause African trypanosomiasis.  

# Key responsibilities

## The post must cover the following responsibilities:

- Validate of high−throughput live imaging system combined with gene silencing screen of protein kinases
- Autophagy-related proximity labelling, phospho-proteomic and mass spectrometry analysis
- Assays of protein interaction and enzyme activity using biophysical and biochemical approaches
- Generation of mutated cell lines by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated precision editing and phenotypic validation in vitro and in murine model
- Biomolecular condensate purification and component analysis by mass spectrometry and sequencing

## Skills, Experience & Qualification needed

- A PhD in Molecular Biology, Cell Biology or Microbiology
- Knowledge in molecular biology, parasitology, and a range of modern techniques, to engage in high quality research
- Skills and experiences in cell culture, handling of class 2 pathogens, murine infection, and gene editing is desirable
- Excellent track record of research publications and highly developed communication skills
- Attention to detail, collaborative ethos with interest in and enthusiasm for co-supervising students
- Positive attitude to colleagues and students and a willingness to work proactively
- Commitment to personal development and understanding of equality and diversity issues
